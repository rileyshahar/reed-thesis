	abstract = "The classical ``BGW protocol'' (Ben-Or, Goldwasser, and Wigderson,
	            STOC 1988) shows that secure multiparty computation (MPC) among n
	            parties can be realized with perfect full security if {\$}{\$}t <
	            n/3{\$}{\$}t<n/3parties are corrupted. This holds against malicious
	            adversaries in the ``standard'' model for MPC, where a fixed set of
	            n parties is involved in the full execution of the protocol.
	            However, the picture is less clear in the mobile adversary setting
	            of Ostrovsky and Yung (PODC 1991), where the adversary may
	            periodically ``move'' by uncorrupting parties and corrupting a new
	            set of t parties. In this setting, it is unclear if full security
	            can be achieved against an adversary that is maximally mobile, i.e.
	            , moves after every round. The question is further motivated by the
	            ``You Only Speak Once'' (YOSO) setting of Gentry et al. (Crypto
	            2021), where not only the adversary is mobile but also each round
	            is executed by a disjoint set of parties. Previous positive results
	            in this model do not achieve perfect security, and either assume
	            probabilistic corruption and a nonstandard communication model, or
	            only realize the weaker goal of security-with-abort. The question
	            of matching the BGW result in these settings remained open.",
