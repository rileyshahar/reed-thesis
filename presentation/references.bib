	            distribution (QKD) do not apply to joint attacks over QKD and the
	            subsequent use of the resulting key. In this paper, we close this
	            potential security gap by using a universal composability theorem
	            for the quantum setting. We first derive a composable security
	            definition for QKD. We then prove that the usual security
	            definition of QKD still implies the composable security definition.
	            Thus, a key produced in any QKD protocol that is unconditionally
	            secure in the usual definition can indeed be safely used, a
	            property of QKD that is hitherto unproven. We propose two other
	            useful sufficient conditions for composability. As a simple
	            application of our result, we show that keys generated by repeated
	            runs of QKD degrade slowly.",
