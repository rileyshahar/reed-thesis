	            their composition and abstraction mechanisms are inadequate: we
	            solve this problem in a satisfactory way. We start by remarking
	            that place/transition Petri nets can be viewed as ordinary,
	            directed graphs equipped with two algebraic operations
	            corresponding to parallell and sequential composition of
	            transitions. A distributive law between the two operations captures
	            a basic fact about concurrency. New morphisms are defined, mapping
	            single, atomic transitions into whole computations, thus relating
	            system descriptions at different levels of abstraction. Categories
	            equipped with products and coproducts (corresponding to parallel
	            and nondeterministic compositions) are introduced for Petri nets
	            with and without initial markings. Petri net duality is expressed
	            as a duality functor, and several new invariants are introduced. A
	            tensor product is defined on nets, and their category is proved to
	            be symmetric monoidal closed. This construction is generalized to a
	            large class of algebraic theories on graphs. These results provide
	            a formal basis for expressing the semantics of concurrent languages
	            in terms of Petri nets. They also provide a new understanding of
	            concurrency in terms of algebraic structures over graphs and
	            categories that should apply to other models besides Petri nets and

	            manifolds representing space. This led to a burst of work on

	            was just the beginning: similar diagrams can be used to reason
	            about logic, where they represent proofs, and computation, where
	            they represent programs. With the rise of interest in quantum

	            be a barrier to entry for those who are used to the stand-alone
	            model of secure computation and wish to work with universally
	            composable security but are overwhelmed by the differences. The
	            variant presented here (called simplified universally composable
	            security, or just SUC) is closer to the definition of security for
	            multiparty computation in the stand-alone setting. The main
	            difference is that a protocol in the SUC framework runs with a
	            fixed set of parties, and machines cannot be added dynamically to
	            the execution. As a result, the definitions of polynomial time and
	            protocol composition are much simpler. In addition, the SUC
	            framework has authenticated channels built in, as is standard in
	            previous definitions of security, and all communication is done via
	            the adversary in order to enable arbitrary scheduling of messages.
	            Due to these differences, not all cryptographic tasks can be
	            expressed in the SUC framework. Nevertheless, standard secure
	            computation tasks (like secure function evaluation) can be
	            expressed. Importantly, we show that for every protocol that can be
	            represented in the SUC framework, the protocol is secure in SUC if
	            and only if it is secure in UC. Therefore, the UC composition
	            theorem holds and any protocol that is proven secure under SUC is
	            secure under the general framework (with some technical changes to
	            the functionality definition). As a result, protocols that are
	            secure in the SUC framework are secure when an a priori unbounded
	            number of concurrent executions of the protocols take place
	            (relative to the same fixed set of parties).},

	            such that security is preserved under concurrent composition with
	            arbitrary other protocols. However, although UC is widely used for
	            on-paper proofs, prior attempts at systemizing it have fallen short
	            , either by using a symbolic model (thereby ruling out

	            In this paper, we lay the groundwork for building a concrete,
	            executable implementation of the UC framework. Our main
	            contribution is a process calculus, dubbed the Interactive Lambda
	            Calculus (ILC). ILC faithfully captures the computational model
	            underlying UC—interactive Turing machines (ITMs)—by adapting ITMs
	            to a subset of the π-calculus through an affine typing discipline.
	            In other words, well-typed ILC programs are expressible as ITMs. In
	            turn, ILC’s strong confluence property enables reasoning about
	            cryptographic security reductions. We use ILC to develop a
	            simplified implementation of UC called SaUCy.},
