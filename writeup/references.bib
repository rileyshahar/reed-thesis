	            their composition and abstraction mechanisms are inadequate: we
	            solve this problem in a satisfactory way. We start by remarking
	            that place/transition Petri nets can be viewed as ordinary,
	            directed graphs equipped with two algebraic operations
	            corresponding to parallell and sequential composition of
	            transitions. A distributive law between the two operations captures
	            a basic fact about concurrency. New morphisms are defined, mapping
	            single, atomic transitions into whole computations, thus relating
	            system descriptions at different levels of abstraction. Categories
	            equipped with products and coproducts (corresponding to parallel
	            and nondeterministic compositions) are introduced for Petri nets
	            with and without initial markings. Petri net duality is expressed
	            as a duality functor, and several new invariants are introduced. A
	            tensor product is defined on nets, and their category is proved to
	            be symmetric monoidal closed. This construction is generalized to a
	            large class of algebraic theories on graphs. These results provide
	            a formal basis for expressing the semantics of concurrent languages
	            in terms of Petri nets. They also provide a new understanding of
	            concurrency in terms of algebraic structures over graphs and
	            categories that should apply to other models besides Petri nets and

	abstract = "In physics, Feynman diagrams are used to reason about quantum
	            processes. In the 1980s, it became clear that underlying these
	            diagrams is a powerful analogy between quantum physics and
	            topology. Namely, a linear operator behaves very much like a
	            ``cobordism'': a manifold representing spacetime, going between two
	            manifolds representing space. This led to a burst of work on
	            topological quantum field theory and ``quantum topology''. But this
	            was just the beginning: similar diagrams can be used to reason
	            about logic, where they represent proofs, and computation, where
	            they represent programs. With the rise of interest in quantum
	            cryptography and quantum computation, it became clear that there is
	            extensive network of analogies between physics, topology, logic and
	            computation. In this expository paper, we make some of these
	            analogies precise using the concept of ``closed symmetric monoidal

	abstract = "String diagrams were introduced by Roger Penrose as a handy
	            notation to manipulate morphisms in a monoidal category. In
	            principle, this graphical notation should encompass the various
	            pictorial systems introduced in proof-theory (like Jean-Yves
	            Girard's proof-nets) and in concurrency theory (like Robin Milner's
	            bigraphs). This is not the case however, at least because string
	            diagrams do not accomodate boxes --- a key ingredient in these
	            pictorial systems. In this short tutorial, based on our accidental
	            rediscovery of an idea by Robin Cockett and Robert Seely, we
	            explain how string diagrams may be extended with a notion of
	            functorial box depicting a functor transporting an inside world
	            (its source category) to an outside world (its target category). We
	            expose two elementary applications of the notation: first, we
	            characterize graphically when a faithful balanced monoidal functor
	            F:ℂ {\$}{\backslash}longrightarrow{\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathbb{\{}D{
	            \}}{\$}transports a trace operator from the category {\$}{
	            \backslash}mathbb{\{}D{\}}{\$}to the category ℂ, and exploit this
	            to construct well-behaved fixpoint operators in cartesian closed
	            categories generated by models of linear logic; second, we explain
	            how the categorical semantics of linear logic induces that the
	            exponential box of proof-nets decomposes as two enshrined boxes.",

	            for common structure in linear logic, such as the exponentials (!,
	            ?), and the additives (product, coproduct), and yet when
	            interpreted in the doctrine of ∗-autonomous categories, gives the
	            familiar notion of monoidal functor. We show that there is a
	            bi-adjunction between the 2-categories of linearly distributive
	            categories and linear functors, and of ∗-autonomous categories and
	            monoidal functors, given by the construction of the “nucleus” of a
	            linearly distributive category. We develop a calculus of proof nets
	            for linear functors, and show how linearity accounts for the
	            essential coherence structure of the exponentials and the
	            additives.},
