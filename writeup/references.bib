	            their composition and abstraction mechanisms are inadequate: we
	            solve this problem in a satisfactory way. We start by remarking
	            that place/transition Petri nets can be viewed as ordinary,
	            directed graphs equipped with two algebraic operations
	            corresponding to parallell and sequential composition of
	            transitions. A distributive law between the two operations captures
	            a basic fact about concurrency. New morphisms are defined, mapping
	            single, atomic transitions into whole computations, thus relating
	            system descriptions at different levels of abstraction. Categories
	            equipped with products and coproducts (corresponding to parallel
	            and nondeterministic compositions) are introduced for Petri nets
	            with and without initial markings. Petri net duality is expressed
	            as a duality functor, and several new invariants are introduced. A
	            tensor product is defined on nets, and their category is proved to
	            be symmetric monoidal closed. This construction is generalized to a
	            large class of algebraic theories on graphs. These results provide
	            a formal basis for expressing the semantics of concurrent languages
	            in terms of Petri nets. They also provide a new understanding of
	            concurrency in terms of algebraic structures over graphs and
	            categories that should apply to other models besides Petri nets and

	            manifolds representing space. This led to a burst of work on

	abstract = "Cryptography is a theory of secret functions. Category theory is a
	            general theory of functions. Cryptography has reached a stage where
	            its structures often take several pages to define, and its formulas
	            sometime run from page to page. Category theory has some
	            complicated definitions as well, but one of its specialties is
	            taming the flood of structure. Cryptography seems to be in need of
	            high level methods, whereas category theory always needs concrete
	            applications. So why is there no categorical cryptography? One
	            reason may be that the foundations of modern cryptography are built
	            from probabilistic polynomial-time Turing machines, and category
	            theory does not have a good handle on such things. On the other
	            hand, such foundational problems might be the very reason why
	            cryptographic constructions often resemble low level machine
	            programming. I present some preliminary explorations towards
	            categorical cryptography. It turns out that some of the main
	            security concepts are easily characterized through diagram chasing,
	            going back to Lambek's seminal `Lecture Notes on Rings and
	            Modules'.",

	            communication and secret sharing, including a characterization of
	            their security properties, which are automatically satisfied with
	            no extra axioms required. This analysis shows that these protocols
	            have an identical abstract form to the quantum teleportation and
	            dense coding procedures, giving a concrete mathematical analogy
	            between quantum and classical computing. Specific implementations
	            of these protocols as nondeterministic classical procedures are
	            recovered by applying our formalism in a symmetric monoidal
	            bicategory of matrices of relations.
