	            communication channels, and the theory of quantum entanglement are
	            prominent examples. Questions addressed by these theories include:
	            Which resources can be converted into which others? At what rate
	            can many copies of one resource be converted into many copies of
	            another? Can a catalyst enable a conversion? How to quantify a
	            resource? We propose a general mathematical definition of resource
	            theory. We prove general theorems about how resource theories can
	            be constructed from theories of processes with a subclass of
	            processes that are freely implementable. These define the means by
	            which costly states and processes can be interconverted. We outline
	            how various existing resource theories fit into our framework,
	            which is a first step in a project of identifying universal
	            features and principles of resource theories. We develop a few
	            general results concerning resource convertibility.},
