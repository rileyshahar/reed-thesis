\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

More people have contributed to this document than I could possibly name. I will
have to settle for an incomplete list.

This thesis would not even have gotten off the ground without my fantastic
advisers: Angélica, who started advising this thesis while on leave, who
constantly indulged my disparate categorical tangents, and who gives better
feedback on drafts than any other mentor I've ever had; and Adam, who advised a
cryptography thesis with a student who hadn't taken cryptography, who was always
willing to chat (complain) about academic politics or messy papers, and who
repeatedly brought me down from spates of abstract nonsense by reminding me to
think about the cryptography.

I am also thankful for the time of my readers, Greg Anderson and Mark Bedau, and
of the numerous academics who have indulged the questions of a too-ambitious
undergrad throughout the year. I specifically want to thank Alex Moll, who was
always willing to answer my very naive questions about probability theory and to
listen to half-baked ideas that were only tangentially relevant to him.

As an academic, I am especially indebted to Jana Comstock, without whom I would
probably have been a physicist; to Jim Fix, who taught me to love types; to
Angélica, who taught me to love categories; to Sierra Maciorowski, who taught me
to love teaching; and to Charlie McGuffey, Zajj Daugherty, Adam, Angélica, and
Steve Zdancewic, who throughout my time at Reed and especially over the last
year have given me advice and support in spades. The mathematician I am
today is inextricable from their influence.

I would feel remiss not to mention the many authors of queer speculative
fictions from whom I draw continual inspiration and strength; among many, I will
mention Ann Leckie, Becky Chambers, Emily Tesh, R. F. Kuang, Rivers Solomon,
Ryka Aoki, and Ursula Le Guin.

Most of all, I would not have gotten through the last four years without the
support of my friends and family. I love and appreciate you all so much.

\begin{dedication}
  Desar's chosen field in mathematics was so esoteric that nobody in the
  Institute or the Math Federation could really check on his progress. That was
  precisely why he had chosen it.

\chapter*{Abstract}
We present introductory material on cryptography and category theory, focused on
the prerequisites to cryptographic composability. We then present the approach
to cryptographic composability of \citeauthor{broadbent-karvonen-2022}. We give
several novel contributions, including a new model for cryptographic protocols
which use both single- and multi-use resources, and a 2-categorical
generalization of their model which incorporates data about computational
reductions.
